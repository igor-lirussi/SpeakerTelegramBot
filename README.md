# SpeakerTelegramBot
**Telegram bot that plays any audio/voice you send in the speakers!**
<br>
For obvious reasons, special commands are present to mute/unmute the bot and to stop the current  audio playing. <br>
Other simple commands can manage the folder of the data downloaded, getting the size and deleting the content remotely. (Just sending a secret message to the bot) <br>
All the active actions are logged in a text file (muting, cleaning folder, sending audio). With another special command is possible to retrieve the responsible for the last five actions.
